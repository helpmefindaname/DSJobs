for predict the reliability of power_semiconductor device statistical lifetime model be use that describe component aging as a function of thermo mechanical stress
the observed failure distribution in cyclic load test consist of the scattering of the damage process and the scattering of the applied load
this relationship can be model with bi variant distribution function
the challenge be that the influence variable do_not follow the same underlying distribution since the lifetime model be non linear and in_addition censor datum have to be take_into account
there_be no analytic solution for this combination so the distribution must be calculate numerically
