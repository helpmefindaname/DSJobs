# DSJobs

"Learn what recruiters have in mind, if they seek for Data Scientists."

The purpose of this project is to build a DS workflow: get data > clean data > analyze > report > learn

This tool searches recruiting services and collets information about DS jobs.
Machine learning will cluster those jobs and analyze what skills are requested by recruiters and how these requirements evolve over time.

This project is in an early stage:

This works already:
o get Jobs from Karriere.at
o save them in a MySQL DB

That doesn't:
o get Jobs from other recruitment sites
o analyze Jobs using ML
o create reports
o create a nice webinterface
